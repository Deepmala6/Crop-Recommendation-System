Crop Recommendation System:----
This project is a crop recommendation system that predicts the best crop to cultivate based on input agricultural parameters such as nitrogen content, phosphorus content, potassium content, temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall.

2. Overview:-----
   The crop recommendation system uses machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to make predictions. It preprocesses input data using MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler for feature scaling before predicting the crop based on a pre-trained model.

3. Features:-----
  . Input agricultural parameters (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall).
   . Predicts the best crop to cultivate from a predefined list based on input parameters.
   . Uses a Random Forest Classifier model trained on agricultural data.

4. Installation
    To run the project locally, follow these steps:

     A. Clone the repository:https://github.com/Deepmala6/Crop-Recommendation-System/.git
    B.  Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
   C. python main.py

5. Usage:----
   . Enter the agricultural parameters when prompted (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall).
   . The system will predict the best crop to cultivate based on the provided parameters.

6. File Descriptions:---
  . main.py: Main script to run the crop recommendation system.
   .  model.pkl: Pre-trained Random Forest Classifier model saved as a pickle file.
   .  README.md: Markdown file containing project overview, installation instructions, usage guide, etc.
